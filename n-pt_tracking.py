# Given: defined number n points equadistance of known distance from centroid in plane parallel to camera plane
# Find: location of centroid in three-dimensional Euclidian space
# Return: record of position of centroid

# Step 1: Initialize Camera
# Step 2: Calibrate Camera w/ system
# Step 3: Initialize Record
# Step 4: Determine Start -> start record
# Step 5: Determine location of centriod
# Step 6: Add determined location to record
# Step 7: Determine End -> end record
# Step 8: Save Record
